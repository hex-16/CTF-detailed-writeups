# CTF-detailed-writeups
Very detailed CTF writeups. Try to make it understandable to CTF beginners. Bilingual in Chinese and English, mainly in Chinese.中英双语 中文为主

Some CTF notes will also be saved under this REPO because of laziness. 因为懒，部分CTF相关笔记也会保存在此repo下。

This REPO is devoted to writing very detailed writeups so that CTF beginners (including me) can replicate the resolution process. 本repo致力于写十分详细的writeup，让CTF beginners也能复现解题过程。~~也可能因为懒，部分writeup会写的比较简洁~~
